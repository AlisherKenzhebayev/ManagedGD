## Project Report
1. Target platform 
	- Both PC + Android, moveset was designed for both
2. Plugins used [R5] 
	- Cinemachine (Player camera follow, slight delay)
3. What have you done for [R6] (Editor Extensions)
	- Patrolling of obstacles
4. Which topic is covered extensively enough [R7]
	- 2D 
5. Which additional requirements are met [A1 - A9]
	- A3 - Particle Effects - TODO:
	- A7 - URP 2D lights - DONE (background, sprites, player)
	- A12 - Extensive Animations - TODO:
6. Summarize what your game is about
	- Seeking the exit from the level, while trying not to die. 
7. What did you enjoy the most
	- Lectures
8. What was your biggest struggle (I will try to improve my lectures according to that next year)
	- Did not have examples of projects
9. Are you satisfied with the result? 
	- To a certain degree, as I mainly explored Physics as means to fake tween the motion and movement of player controller + Animaiton and 2D lights in URP, so I'm happy with my main goals.
10. What will you recommend to other people picking the same game?
	- Plan ahead what you want to do, and gameplay, as mine is boring, but the character controller is one of the best ones I did so far. 
	+ I adapted inputs to both platforms
